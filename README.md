# Indie-RPG-Project

Hello & Welcome,

I've consistently been turned off by most games I've played in my life, but especially when it comes to multiplayer and, "Online Interactive Worlds." I've been unhappy with MMOs, unhappy with sandbox builders and unhappy with apps on the appstore. My first step has been to create a barebones framework to test the limits of my abilities, as this is my first forray into C# and my first serious dive into programming altogether. 

Thus far, I have met my pre-Alpha timeline and am trying to find the time to take the project into the BETA stage. Currently I'm looking into a P2P file transfer tutorial which I plan on integrating to make the tilemap and network features decentralized, and eventually adding some elements of nlockchain/cryptography for security, easy of use, efficiency, scalability and increased utility. 

One of the primary goals for this project is to create as close of a simulation of reality, with a realistic representation of an economy, at least as far as it services the game when I consider the way I'd like to play it. Part of this is to create a robust and tiered society. You can gather resources, build or craft things, but you could also start a group to get those things done faster. There is currently no active concept for the, "player," other than the METADATA for their actions. 

Each unit in this game is essentially a worker, and their goal is to generate, through work, value for the economy. This frees up the players to pursue more interesting things than running a dungeon for the 100th time or farming iron ore. You can pursue your expertise in craftsmanship, pursue your expertise and knowledge in the realm of magic or work your way up the ladder of society. Start a business, conquer land, create domains or run for office. 

Everything is proceedurally generated and this is just the tip of the iceberg. I have a pretty good idea on the scope of this project, and have a decent idea on how it will work and how I can make it happen. The only hurdles for me currently are finding the time to devote to this project, and then working past my own inadequecies as a novice programmer to find the functions and utilities that will make all of this possible. P2P connections supported by centralized servers seem obtainable, and blockchain/cryptopgrahpy seem possible, I just have to figure out all the functions I need to make them happen, and then integrate them together.

My primary reason for posting this project in GitHub is to track my progress and to offer another form of back-up for my project. I do plan on having a team for this if I see promise in the project, but I currently don't have the confidence to devote serious time or resources to the project over other things in my life currently. If literally anybody reads this and is interested in simply talking to me about it, let alone helping, offering advice or even code, I'll welcome you with open arms & ears. Twitter.com/Nadrojiskool
